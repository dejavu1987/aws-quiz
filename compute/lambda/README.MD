# AWS Lambda

## Features of AWS Lambda

Which of the following are features of Lambda? (Select FOUR.)

- [x] You can run code without provisioning or managing servers.
- [x] It initiates functions on your behalf in response to events.
- [ ] You don't need to configure memory or CPU.
- [x] It scales automatically.
- [x] It provides built-in monitoring and logging.
- [ ] You can update the operating system dynamically.

#### Explanation

AWS Lambda allows you to run code without managing servers, initiates functions in response to events, scales automatically, and provides built-in monitoring and logging. Memory configuration is required, but CPU and OS updates are handled by AWS.

## Invocation Models in AWS Lambda

Which statements about invocation models are correct? (Select THREE.)

- [x] Amazon S3 triggers Lambda via an asynchronous push.
- [x] Amazon API Gateway triggers Lambda synchronously.
- [ ] When Alexa is the event source, Lambda will make three attempts to invoke the function before putting the failed invocation into the dead letter queue (DLQ).
- [ ] DynamoDB must have an execution role to invoke Lambda.
- [x] Amazon SQS triggers Lambda via the polling invocation model.

#### Explanation

Correct! Amazon S3 and Amazon API Gateway use asynchronous and synchronous push models, respectively. For Alexa, there are no automatic retries, and DynamoDB does not require an execution role for invoking Lambda. Amazon SQS uses the polling invocation model for triggering Lambda.


## IAM Entities for Lambda Function Interaction

What IAM entities must be included in an execution role for a Lambda function to interact with other services, such as DynamoDB? (Select TWO.)

- [x] IAM policy that defines the actions that can be taken within DynamoDB
- [x] Trust policy that grants "AssumeRole" permission to Lambda to act on DynamoDB
- [ ] IAM group defining users of the Lambda function
- [ ] IAM user with admin permissions to Lambda and DynamoDB

#### Explanation

You need both the IAM policy that defines the actions Lambda can take and a trust policy that grants Lambda the "AssumeRole" permission. You do not have to create any IAM users or groups to allow Lambda to take action.

## Resource Policy in AWS Lambda

Which of these statements describe a resource policy? (Select THREE.)

- [ ] Must be chosen or created when you create a Lambda function
- [x] Can give Amazon S3 permission to initiate a Lambda function
- [ ] Can give Lambda permission to write data to a DynamoDB table
- [x] Can grant access to the Lambda function across AWS accounts
- [x] Determines who has access to invoke the function
- [ ] Determines what Lambda is allowed to do

#### Explanation

Correct! A resource policy determines who can initiate your function (e.g., Amazon S3), grants access across accounts, and controls who has access to invoke the function. It is not chosen or created when creating a Lambda function and does not specify what Lambda is allowed to do; that is controlled by the execution role's IAM policy.

## Match Lambda Function Terms to Definitions


| Lambda Function Terms      | Definitions                                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Handler method             | An entry point that AWS Lambda calls to initiate your Lambda function |
| Context object             | This is generated by AWS and provides metadata about the action |
| Event object               | An object with information about the event that initiated the Lambda function |

#### Explanation

The handler method is the entry point to your Lambda function. The event object provides information about the event that initiated the Lambda function. The context object is generated by AWS and provides metadata about the execution.



## AWS Lambda Authoring using AWS Management Console

What is the best purpose for authoring using the AWS Management Console?

- [ ] Small standalone applications less than 10 MB package
- [x] Simple one-function applications with no custom libraries and experimentation
- [ ] Packages greater than 10 MB or part of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) managed applications

#### Explanation

That's correct! The Lambda management console is best for simple functions with no custom libraries and is a great way to start experimenting with Lambda.
